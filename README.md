# Twitter_sentiment_analysis
I will use Textblob natural language processing (NLP) along with other NLP frameworks to classify tweets.
The idea is 'simple' grabs tweets and use sentiment analysis for classifying as positive or negative, typically on a scale of -1.0 to 1.0.In particular, the scale is as follows:bad -1.0, 0.0 neutral, and 1.0 as postive.
